# 🚀 Oasis InfoByte Java Programming Internship Tasks 🚀

Welcome to the Oasis InfoByte Java Programming Internship! 🎉 During my time as an intern at Oasis InfoByte, I had the chance to dive into some awesome Java projects. Let's explore the cool stuff I worked on! 😎

## 1) Number Guessing Game 🎮
- **Description:** Think you're good at guessing? This project is all about creating a Java-based number guessing game. Players have just 3 tries to guess the secret number, and they can use only 1 hint. It's a fun challenge that puts your Java skills to the test!

- **Key Features:**
  - Limited attempts (3 tries).
  - Hint system (1 hint allowed).
  - Interactive user interface.


## 2) ATM Interface 💰
- **Description:** Feeling like you need an ATM on your computer? The ATM Interface project is a Java-based ATM simulation. You can perform all the classic ATM operations, like checking account balances, withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and transferring money between accounts.

- **Key Features:**
  - Check account balance.
  - Withdraw and deposit funds.
  - Transfer money between accounts.
  - User authentication for security.

## Getting Started 🚀
